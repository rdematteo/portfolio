  <li>Design process</li>
It was difficult to come up with a design and started to think about a primary colour scheme of blue (my favourite color) and use of secondary, tertiary colours from this initial colour. I came across a webpage that used a photgraph for the background https://www.loungelizard.com/.



  This inspired me to use a photgraph that I have taken. The photo i used was taken near my home. It is located at a horse agistment property in Bangholme, Victoria. My partner owns and rides horses as a hobby and I used to help her feed them in the early morning. On a misty morning (Feb 6, 2013), the sun was rising behind a shed, and thought this would be a nice photo. I have used this photo as an inpiration in my design. I enjoy taking photos.<br>

**insert photo here**



The design of my page compliments my character. Not complex, delivering information in an easy format. 
I learn by experimenting and making mistakes however I keep the end goal in mind.

See attached picture


Colors
I have picked 4 colours from the photo and then went to https://mycolor.space to create colour palettes. Refer to figma https://www.figma.com/file/0qotQLAdC2JRfx9pZwfWniMX/Portfolio?node-id=0%3A1 or sceen shot below 



Fonts
I visited https://www.canva.com/learn/canva-for-work-brand-fonts/ to view font combinations. From the three combinations I choose, i then visited google.fonts to see if they are available. Google fonts also have suggested pairings. Out of the 3 different options, two fonts were not avaiable. Thus I have chosen, Merriweather font with the suggesgtions from Google fonts

About me page.
I had a few options with design of page. Either a full picture or crop the picture and paste across top and down one side. Nav Bar in side pic. I decided on the later design. 
I structured the content in with 2 row. Top row has two columns - one with title of page and the other with my photo. The bottom row has same width as top row and contains text.

Skills page.
Same design with pictures across top and left-hand-side from about me page.
I hvae three main industry sectors where I have gained/gaining my skills 1)Coder Academy 2)research industry 3) University sector. I have decided to make three columns; one for each skill base.  
There will be three rows.
First row; title
Second Row; Descritpion about different idustries
Third row; 3 columns, each with a separate skill base. Each skill base will be coloured.

Creation of github pages
link https://github.com/rdematteo/portfolio/tree/master

Reduce an image's file size
In the Preview app on your Mac, open the file you want to change.
Choose Tools > Adjust Size, then select “Resample image.”
Enter a smaller value in the Resolution field. The new size is shown at the bottom. Custom size: 1440x900px. reduced image siaze from 1.6MG to 301kb

Hard coding pages
In general all separate pages will be contained in separate folders. 
I will create a buttons css file and import into each index.css file.


Landing page.
Found it difficult to position elements on the page. 
Found it difficult to change colors of icons. Lots of fiddling with attributes and functions to achieve desired result.
Had an issue with div lining up vertically. Found content was going off full page. Solution; put eveything in an outer-container.


About me
Again position of elements was difficult. Initially position nav bar on RHS in its own div element but then found it difficult to align all other div elements. I needed to include the nav div in the main container.
Learned that the a tag is overridden by class. need to enclose a and class in the same tag. The I could remove text decoration.
Coloring the position of the boxes helpd immensley in term of positioning.
Now the basic format of page is constructed the other pahes should be easier to construct. 
**Include photo**

Skills page
Getting a little faster to produce the webpage. Starting to get a good understanding of flexbox and its attributes. Using the different background colors for my different skill bases is going to be a challenge. I will need to experiemnts with different colors to achieve the best result. Here is an example 
**photo skill **

Contacts page.


Styles
I have created a separate buttons style folder and used @ and color: var() function to use hex colours. 
Each page has its own style folder. 

Netlify
Connected my github page to neflify https://www.netlify.com/.  Very easy to connect to my repository/portfolio.
Changed the name to https://rdematteo.netlify.com/


Media changes
Making changes to design for tablet and mobile device.
Decided to use two breaking points
1) max-width: 700px
2) max-width: 1200px and min-width: 700px. Will sue this for remainder of project.

Learned to change vh to auto!!

Needed to add h1,h2 etc to my page to make it searchable

Inserted a favicon.

*Trello*
<p>I used trello to track what (i)to do (ii)doing and (iii)completed.</p>

![trello 1](https://github.com/rdematteo/portfolio/blob/master/pics-README/trello_1.png)

![trello 2](https://github.com/rdematteo/portfolio/blob/master/pics-README/trello_2.png)

*Process*
<p>It was difficult to come up with a design and started to think about a primary colour scheme of blue (my favourite color) and use of secondary, tertiary colours from this initial colour. I came across a webpage that used a photgraph for the background https://www.loungelizard.com/.</p>

![inspiration-site](https://github.com/rdematteo/portfolio/blob/master/pics-README/inspiration.png)


<p>This inspired me to use a photograph that I had taken. The photo i used was taken near my home. It is located at a horse agistment property in Bangholme, Victoria. My partner owns and rides horses as a hobby and I used to help her feed them in the early morning. On a misty morning (Feb 6, 2013), the sun was rising behind a shed, and thought this would be a nice photo. I have used this photo as an inpiration in my design. I enjoy taking photos and have included a couple on the about me page.</p>

![inspiration-photo](https://github.com/rdematteo/portfolio/blob/master/pics/landing_page_smaller_res.jpg)

**<p>Figma</p>**
<p>I have used figma to create my webpage. It includes the inspiraation, wireframes (laptop and mobile), color palettes, fonts. Refer to figma https://www.figma.com/file/0qotQLAdC2JRfx9pZwfWniMX/Portfolio?node-id=0%3A1<p>

![figma_all](https://github.com/rdematteo/portfolio/blob/master/pics-README/figma_all.png)


<p>The design of my page compliments my character. Not complex, delivering information in an easy format.</p>
I learn by experimenting and making mistakes however I keep the end goal in mind. 

*Colors*
<p>I have picked 4 colours from the photo and then went to https://mycolor.space to create colour palettes.</p>

![color palettes](https://github.com/rdematteo/portfolio/blob/master/pics-README/color_pallete.png)

<p>Taken from mycolor.space</p>

*Fonts*
<p>I visited https://www.canva.com/learn/canva-for-work-brand-fonts/ to view font combinations. From the three combinations I choose, i then visited google.fonts to see if they are available. Google fonts also have suggested pairings. Out of the 3 different options, two fonts were not avaiable. Thus I have chosen, Merriweather font with the suggesgtions from Google fonts for the other fonts, namely Montserrat and Oswald.</p> 

![fonts](https://github.com/rdematteo/portfolio/blob/master/pics-README/font_pairings.png)


*About me page*
<p>I had a few options with design of page. Either a full picture or crop the picture and paste across top and down one side. Nav Bar in side pic. I decided on the later design.</p>

![about me](https://github.com/rdematteo/portfolio/blob/master/pics-README/figma_about_me.png)

*Skills page*
<p>Same design with pictures across top and left-hand-side from about me page.
I have three main industry sectors where I have gained/gaining my skills 1) Coder Academy 2) research industry 3) University sector. I have decided to make three columns; one for each skill base and siatisfy criteria for study and work history</p>
<ul>There will be three rows.
  <li>First row; title</li>
  <li>Second Row; Description about different industries</li>
  <li>Third row; 3 columns, each with a separate skill base. Each skill base will be coloured.</li>
</ul>

![skills](https://github.com/rdematteo/portfolio/blob/master/pics-README/figma_skills.png)

*Colors selection*
It was difficult to find the most appropriate colors for the 3 panels. This was my first design.

![skills panel color design initial](https://github.com/rdematteo/portfolio/blob/master/pics-README/skills_panel_initial.png)

I then used a color wheel calculator https://www.sessions.edu/color-calculator/ to find a tetrdic of color for my main brown color (#4c2a05) 

![skills panel color design initial](https://github.com/rdematteo/portfolio/blob/master/pics-README/skills_color_wheel.png)

and light shades of the new three colors

and the final result!!

![git hub log](https://github.com/rdematteo/portfolio/blob/master/pics-README/git_hub_log.png)

*Directory setup in github*
<ul>
  <li>All separate webpages will be in contained in separate folders.</li>
  <li>I will create a buttons css file and import into each index.css file.</li>
  <li>I will use var for commonly used colors".</li>
</ul>

*Reduce an image's file size*
<p>These are the instruction to resize image so page does not take a long time to load.</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Preview app on your Mac, open the file you want to change.</li>
  <li>Choose Tools > Adjust Size, then select “Resample image.”</li>
  <li>Enter a smaller value in the Resolution field. The new size is shown at the bottom. Custom size: 1440x900px. reduced image siaze from 1.6MG to 301kb</li>
</ol>




**<p>Hard Coding pages</p>**
*Landing page.*
<p>Found it difficult to position elements on the page.</p> 
<p>Found it difficult to change colors of icons. Lots of fiddling with attributes and functions to achieve desired result.</p>
<p>Had an issue with div lining up vertically. Found content was going off full page. Solution; put eveything in an outer-div called container.</p>

![html about me page](https://github.com/rdematteo/portfolio/blob/master/pics-README/html_landing.png)

*About me*
<p>I structured the content in with 2 row. Top row has two columns - one with title of page and the other with my photo. The bottom row has same width as top row and contains text. This is illustrated below.</p>

![about me](https://github.com/rdematteo/portfolio/blob/master/pics-README/about_me_div_colors.png)

<p>Again position of elements was difficult. Initially position nav bar on RHS in its own div element but then found it difficult to align all other div elements. I needed to include the nav div in the main container.</p>
<p>Learned that the a tag is overridden by class. need to enclose a and class in the same tag. Then I could remove text decoration.</p>
<p>Coloring the position of the boxes helpd immensley in term of positioning.</p>
<p>Now the basic format of page is constructed the other parts should be easier to construct.</p>

![about me](https://github.com/rdematteo/portfolio/blob/master/pics-README/html_aboutme.png)

*Skills page*
<p>Getting a little faster to produce the webpage. Starting to get a good understanding of flexbox and its attributes. Using the different background colors for my different skill bases is going to be a challenge. I will need to experiment with different colors to achieve the best result. Here is an example</p>

![skills page colors](https://github.com/rdematteo/portfolio/blob/master/pics-README/skills_color_trial.png)

*Contacts page*
<p>Created but not happy with page. Has no simple design to it. Unfortuneatley I did not take a screen shot of it. I searched the web and found a contact me page I liked and will try to re-create some aspects of it's style.</p>

![contact me idea](https://github.com/rdematteo/portfolio/blob/master/pics-README/contact_me_idea.png)

*Style Pages*
</p>I have created a separate buttons style folder and used @ and color: var() function to use hex colours. 
Each page has its own style folder.</p>

*Netlify*
<p>Connected my github page to neflify https://www.netlify.com/.  Very easy to connect to my repository/portfolio.</p>
<p>hanged the name to https://rdematteo.netlify.com/</p>

*Media queries*
<p>Making changes to design for tablet and mobile device</p>
<p>Decided to use two breaking points</p>
<ol>
  <li>max-width: 700px</li>
  <li>max-width: 1200px and min-width: 700px. Will sue this for remainder of project.</p>
</ol>

*Miscellaneous*
<ul>
  <li>Learned to change vh to auto!!</li>
  <li>Needed to add h1,h2 etc to my page to make it searchable</li>
  <li>I didn't create a personal logo but created a favicon. Inserted a favicon.</li>
</ul>

![favicon](https://github.com/rdematteo/portfolio/blob/master/pics-README/favicon.png)

<p></p>

*Usability considerations*
<p>I have tried to space items as much as possible and make text as big as possible."
<p>I have utilised media querries to make the web page responsive to be displayed approriately on laptop, tablet and mobile. For mobile I desinged for the smallest iPhone on the inspect page: iPhone 5/SE.</p>
<p>Decided to use two breaking points</p>
<ol>
  <li>max-width: 700px</li>
  <li>max-width: 1200px and min-width: 700px. Will sue this for remainder of project.</p>
</ol>
<p></p>

**Short Answer Q&A - Include short answers to the following questions**
<ol>
  <li>Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words)</li>
    <p>During the 1980s the PC and Macintosh were developed. The SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) was published and a three-tiered structure involving ARPANET, a TELENET-based system, and an e-mail only service called PhoneNet is created.  The Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) was standardized and the Domain Name system (DNS) is created.  Commercial Internet service providers (ISPs) emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  On March 12 1989, Sir Tim Berners-Lee wrote a proposal then in 1991 introduced the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the first Web browser, the first HTTP server software, the first web server, and the first Web pages.  In April 1995, all commercialization restrictions on the Internet are lifted. Java in introduced in 1995. Google is founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page on September 7, 1998.  In 2004 Facebook goes online.  In 2006 AOL changes its business model.

<li>Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words)</li>
  <p>The internet is communication between two computers, the client and the server. The client is a device that can connect to the internet (e.g. computer/phone) and uses web browsers (e.g. Firefox/Chrome). Servers are computers that store webpages, sites or apps. The client and servers are connect via Internet Service Providers (ISP) and supply the Internet Protocol (IP) address to clients and servers. The IP address is a number assigned to individual client and servers.</p>
  <p>When a client sends a web address, via the browser, the browser sends this information to the Domain Name Server (DNS) to find the IP address of the server.  The browser then sends an HTTP request message to the server asking to send a copy of the website to the client. If the server approves the client can then view the website. All data between the client and server is send using TCP/IP.</p>
 
<li>Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words)</li>
<p>Internet technology is the ability of the Internet to transmit information and data through different servers and systems. One of these is Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).  It is the coding language that gives a website its look and layout. Along with HTML, CSS is fundamental to web design. Without it, websites would still be plain text on white backgrounds.</p>
<p>The initial CSS proposal was presented at the Web conference in Chicago in November 1994 by Hakon Wium Lie and Bert Bos, then a second conference presentation in 1995. CSS level 1 emerged as a W3C Recommendation in December 1996. The first commercial browser to support CSS was Microsoft's Internet Explorer 3, in 1996. The next browser to support CSS was Netscape Navigator (v4.0). The third browser that used CSS was Opera in 1998. CSS level 2 was published as a recommendation in May 1998, CSS 3 drafts were published in June 1999, while CSS level 4 modules were released from September 2017.</p>
<p>CSS was not widely supported until 2000 with the release of Internet Explorer 5. Since that time, CSS have become a standard part of any site and used almost worldwide.</p>

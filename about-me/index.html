        <div class="lower"><p>Not happy where my career was heading as a Research scientist I decided I needed a new direction and knew that a career in coding was the way forward for me. I started the Fast-track Bootcamp at Coder Academy (Melbourne, Australia ) in February 2019 and I am excited with the future.</p><p>I have 16+ years’ experience as Postdoctoral Research Scientist in the field of Biomedical Sciences.  My research has made significant contributions to the area of neonatology (babies) and hopefully will contribute to improving the health and outcomes of our most vulnerable members of society.</p><p>Working in the University sector as a research scientist has provided valuable experience in the field of education and learning.  I have a Diploma in Secondary Education and have 2 years’ experience as an Education Convenor in the tertiary sector.</p><p>Overall these experiences have moulded me with the desire to experiment, learn, reflect, adapt, teach. The ultimate satisfaction is a sense of achievement; not only self-achievement but observing the achievement of others.</p>
